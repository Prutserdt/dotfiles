# :sparkles:Dotfiles:sparkles: repo, including my dwm build and my qmk Redox and Gergo keyboard configurations
Here I store the :sparkles:dotfiles:sparkles: of my GNU/Linux system plus some 
other stuff. Some of my dotfiles are: alacritty, newsboat, vifm, vim.

My build of dwm, a dynamic window manager, can be found [here](https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/suckless/dwm). 

This typically how my desktop looks like:

The qmk configurations of the ortholinear ergonomic split keyboards Redox and Gergo are living [here](https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/Stack/qmk_configurations).

My old i3 gaps config file and surf and st builds are still a part of this repo 
although I do not use them anymore.
