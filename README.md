# :sparkles:Dotfiles:sparkles: repo
Here I store the dotfiles of my GNU/Linux system plus some other stuff.

My config of qtile, a hackable tiling window manager written in python, can be 
found [here](https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/qtile/config.py). 

My build of dwm, a dynamic window manager, can be found 
[here](https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/suckless/dwm). 

This is my typical setup (qtile/dwm), minimal and boring:

The qmk configurations of the ortholinear ergonomic split keyboards Redox and 
Gergo are living [here](https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/Stack/qmk_configurations).

My old i3 gaps config file and surf and st builds are still a part of this repo 
although I do not use them anymore.
