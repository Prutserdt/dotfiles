# :sparkles:Dotfiles:sparkles: repo, including my suckless builds:bangbang:
Here I store the :sparkles:dotfiles:sparkles: of my GNU/Linux system plus some 
other stuff.

[This directory](https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/suckless) 
contains my suckless builds, including my window manager (dwm) and my terminal (st). 

This is how my dwm desktop can look like:

This is how I use it:

My old i3 gaps config file is still a part of this repo although I do not use it 
anymore.
