* About this config
This is my personal [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] config. Nothing much to see here. Just started this journey and learning [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] along the way. The Emacs Lisp files [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.doom.d/init.el][init.el]], [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.doom.d/packages.el][packages.el]] and [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.doom.d/config.el][config.el]] are generated from [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.doom.d/README.org][this README.org file]] by tangling in Emacs ~M-x~ ~org-babel-tangle~. Remember to run =~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync= in the terminal, or ~M-x~ ~org-babel-tangle~ in Doom Emacs, after modifying this README.org!

* init.el
This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in and the first line of the file is lexical binding. This makes the file run (sligthly) faster.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

Add a note to ~init.el~ to highlight that this file should not be edited directly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;; NOTE: This file is generated from the README.org file. Do not alter
;; init.el directly and only modify the README.org file in emacs and
;; 'M-x' 'org-babel-tangle' and reload by 'M-x' 'doom/reload'

#+end_src

The list of available modules can be checked in Doom Emacs by ~M-x~ ~Doom/help-modules~ and can be added to the list of modules listed below.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el

#+end_src

* packages.el
Here the packages are defined which should be installed. This is an addition to the already installed and loaded modules of ~init.el~. This file shouln't be byte compiled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

Again a NOTE is added to ~packages.el~ to *not* edit this file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;; NOTE: This file is generated from the README.org file. Do not alter
;; packages.el directly and only modify the README.org file in emacs by
;; 'M-x' 'org-babel-tangle' and reload by 'M-x' 'doom/reload'
#+end_src

This part will refresh the packages after every reload, which is not needed actually and this part can be removed. I leave it here for a while and will remove it if I'm sure it's not needed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;;(require 'package)
;;(add-to-list 'package-archives
;;             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
;;(package-refresh-contents)
;;(package-initialize)
#+end_src

A package can be installed from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror by (package! package_name). The beacon package is not part of the Doom Emacs modules and is added here. /Never lose your cursor again/ by highlighting the cursor after scrolling.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! beacon)
#+end_src

Centering text to the middle of the window can be done by the visual-fill-column package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! visual-fill-column)
#+end_src

The nose package is already installed in Doom Emacs but it is not maintained and leading to an ~:lang python error~. Therefore this package is disabled. Note: disabling of core packages might lead to terrible side effects!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;;(package! nose :disable t)
#+end_src

* config.el
The custom configurations are set here. For instance theme settings, image to the doom splash screen, transparency, relative numbering and email settings.

Let's remind the reader of ~config.el~ to not edit this file directly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
;; NOTE: This file is generated from the README.org file. Do not alter
;; config.el directly and only modify the README.org file in emacs and
;; 'M-x' 'org-babel-tangle' and reload by 'M-x' 'doom/reload'
#+end_src

The default setting of Evil mode in Doom Emacs is to use Y in normal mode to yank the whole line from the cursor position. This is obviously the *incorrect* way and is reverted here to copy the whole line, regardless of cursor position.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(setq! evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol nil)
#+end_src

The doom-emacs image of the welcome screen is added here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(setq fancy-splash-image "~/.doom.d/doom-emacs.png")
#+end_src

Finding the cursor can be tricky after scrolling or page up/down. The beacon module comes to the resque by highlighing the cursor area! /Never lose your cursor again/. Because I'm slow I set the blinkin duration to a whole 3 seconds.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(beacon-mode 1)
(setq beacon-blink-duration 3)
#+end_src

Another trick to make the cursor stand out more in Evil mode is to use the color tomato for the cursor in normal mode. It pops right out. A white bar is set for insert mode and a hollow orange cursor for visual mode. This helps to differentiate between normal/insert/visual mode.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(setq evil-normal-state-cursor '(box "tomato")
      evil-insert-state-cursor '(bar "white")
      evil-visual-state-cursor '(hollow "orange"))
#+end_src

More eye candy by superstar bullets in org mode instead of the default boring *. This requires (org +pretty) in ~init.el~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(setq org-superstar-headline-bullets-list '("◉" "○" "✿" "✸" "⁖" ))
#+end_src

Flashing of yanked text is already set out of the box in Doom Emacs. I'm kinda slow and like the flashing to take longer. The default is 0.2 second and set it here to a whole second.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(setq evil-goggles-duration 1.0)
#+end_src

Elisp is parentheses galore! The package rainbow-delimiters is matching the colors of parenthesis and this helps navigating code. Also handy for other languages.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(use-package rainbow-delimiters)
#+end_src

The superior font is chosen here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(set-frame-font "Hack 12" t t)
(setq default-frame-alist '((font . "Hack 13")))
#+end_src

For ultrawide monitors I prefer to set my working window in the middle of the screen. In my case I use qtile window manager with monadthreecolumn and emacs in the middle column. With visual-fill emacs can be set to be in the middle of the window. This works with the three column layout and is especially nice for maximized windows on an ultrawide. Now it's perfectly in the middle and distraction free.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(setq-default fill-column 110)
(global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode)
(add-hook 'visual-line-mode-hook 'visual-fill-column-mode)
(setq-default visual-fill-column-center-text t)
#+end_src

Set relative numbering. In Doom Emacs it can also be toggled by ~SPC~ ~t~ ~l~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(global-display-line-numbers-mode)
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

Emacs and Doom Emacs use a lot of keybindings. I try not to interfere with those and use ~SPC~ ~d~. This area is under construction.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(map! :leader
      (:prefix ("d" . "Personal Bindings")
       :desc "Switch to buffer"
       "b" #'switch-to-buffer
       :desc "Increase font size"
       "i" #'doom/increase-font-size
       :desc "Kill current buffer"
       "k" #'kill-this-buffer
       :desc "Kill some buffers"
       "K" #'kill-some-buffers
       :desc "Open recent files"
       "o" #'recentf-open-more-files
       :desc "Reload Doom: doom/reload"
       "r" #'doom/reload
       :desc "Tangling: org-babel-tangle"
       "t" #'org-babel-tangle)
                )
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: org-babel-tangle

Get a glimpse of the desktop background by setting a low transparency for Emacs.
NOTE: if this part is placed at the start of ~config.el~ then transparency does not work.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha '(95 90))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha 95 90))
#+end_src

Remove the scroll bar. NOTE: does not work when it's at the start of config.el.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

* TODOs
Here is a list of things I want to add/improve in my Doom Emacs configuration. This part is /under construction/.

*Create custom welcome screen (splash screen)*

It would be nice to change it, modifying the default requires too much effort. Just create a simple page with an image and a few options shoudl be relatively simple....

*MU4e*

Needs to be configured properly...
mu4e should be added to ~init.el~ (mu4e +org +gmail) and/or the mu4e package should be added to ~package.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; The email package MU for emacs
(package! mu4e)

#+end_src

The following code block should be part of config.el:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(setq mail-user-agent 'mu4e-user-agent)
(set-email-account!
 "transip"
 '((mu4e-sent-folder       . "/transip/Sent Mail")
   (mu4e-trash-folder      . "/transip/Bin")
   (smtpmail-smtp-user     . "email@adress.com"))
 t)
(setq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync transip "
    ;; get emails and index every 5 minutes
      mu4e-update-interval 300
      ;; send emails with format=flowed
      mu4e-compose-format-flowed t
      ;; no need to run cleanup after indexing for gmail
      mu4e-index-cleanup nil
      mu4e-index-lazy-check t
      ;; more sensible date format
      mu4e-headers-date-format "%d.%m.%y")
;; tell message-mode how to send mail
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
;; if our mail server lives at smtp.example.org; if you have a local
;; mail-server, simply use 'localhost' here.
(setq smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.transip.email")
