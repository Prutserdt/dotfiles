* About this config
This is my personal Doom Emacs config. Nothing much to see here. Just started this journey and learning Emacs and literate programming along the way. The emacs files init.el, packages.el and config.el are generated from this README.org file by tangling in Emacs (Alt-x and typing: =org-babel-tangle=). Remember to run =doom sync= in the terminal after modifying it!

* init.el
Small modifications from the default Doom Emacs settings. This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in. Remember to tangle this README.org file and running 'doom sync' after modifying it!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; NOTE This file is generated from the README.org file. Do not alter this
;; init.el directly and only modify the REAME.org file then Alt-x and type:
;; 'org-babel-tangle' in emacs and run 'doom sync' in the terminal.
;; Happy hacking :-)

#+end_src

* packages.el
Here the packages are defined which should be installed. This is an addition to the already installed and loaded modules of init.el.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-

;; NOTE This file is generated from the README.org file. Do not alter this
;; packages.el directly and only modify the REAME.org file then Alt-x and type:
;; 'org-babel-tangle' in emacs and run 'doom sync' in the terminal. Happy hacking :-)

;;; $DOOMDIR/packages.el

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")

;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;(unpin! t)

(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-refresh-contents)
(package-initialize)

;; nose package is not maintained and giving :lang python error, disabled
(package! nose           :disable t)


#+end_src

* config.el
Some custom configuration is set here. For instance the relative numbers are set, which resets the current line to zero

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el

;; NOTE This file is generated from the README.org file. Do not alter this
;; config.el directly and only modify the REAME.org file, then Alt-x and type:
;; 'org-babel-tangle' in emacs and run 'doom sync' in the terminal.

;; Evil Mode
(use-package evil
  :ensure t
  :config

;;  (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)

;;  (use-package powerline-evil
;;    :ensure t
;;    :config
;;    (powerline-evil-vim-color-theme)
;;    )
  )

;; Style of line numbering, set to `relative' for relative number.
(setq display-line-numbers-mode relative)
