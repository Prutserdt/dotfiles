! This dotfile can be triggered by the .bashrc and by
! entering xmodmap ~/kbswitch

! Super_R key is set to mod3, this button is used for keybindings to apps in i3wm, see ~/.config/i3/config
remove mod4 = Super_R
add mod3 = Super_R

! A little hack for VIM. The Caps_Lock becomes the Escape key and vice versa.

keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock
