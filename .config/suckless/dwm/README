This is my build of dwm - dynamic window manager. An extremely fast, small, 
and dynamic window manager for X.

Check the log directory for the applied patches.
Check the config.h file for my key bindings. Super_R and Alt_R buttons are set
by .Xmodmap.

My builds are made in my home directory (~/.config/suckless/dwm). 
Place the files of this dwm build in that directory and enter as normal user:
make clean install

Make a symlink to ~/bin
'ln -s -v ~/.config/suckless/dwm/dwm ~/bin/dwm'

-----------
Running dwm
-----------
Add the following lines to your ~/.xinitrc:

    ~/.config/dwmbar.sh &   # Menu bar (see dotfiles repo: .config)
    picom -b                # Start picom, for transparancy
    exec dwm                # Run dwm, a sym link in  ~/bin, and the path was set in .bashrc
    while type dwm >/dev/null ; do dwm && continue || break ; done # to restart in place

Now start dwm by running 'startx' from commandline.

-----------
dwm patching
------------
1. Download a patch from suckless.org and place the patch at a set location 
   (~/Stack/suckless/dwm/patches/test)
2. Run from command line the .bashrc alias: dwmpatch
3. If the patch is usefull then safe dwm as a stable version.

-----------
Safe as stable version: dwmbackup (an .bashrc alias) in command line
Restore stable version: dwmstable (an .bashrc alias) in command line
Run vanilla dwm:        dwmvanilla (an .bashrc alias) in command line
-----------
