/home/icefly/Stack/suckless/dwm/patches/test/dwm-scratchpads-20200414-728d397b.diff
* Testing scratchpads functionality, calculator changed to deepin-calculator
* Changed colors to be inline with gruvbox and simplified config.h colors
* Exiting dwm by scratchpad and exitdwm.sh
* Tightening up config.h, removing duplicates, alignment of comments, switched
* from deepin-calculator to qalculate!
* Switched to alacrity. Unfortunately the st terminal is needed for my
* scratchpads setup. Next time patch with namedscratchpad (tip from Reddit)
/home/icefly/Stack/suckless/dwm/patches/test/dwm-fixborders-6.2.diff
* Tricky to get fullscreen working.... I tried to use the actualfullscreen
* patch but that did not work, plus the width of windows could not be adjusted
* after the patch (mod h and mod l). Alternativerly I tried the fullscreen
* patch, that did not work as well. Instead of fullscreen the bar was filled
* with some pixels. I checked the code and made a small adjustment to the
* patch: the line:	setlayout(&((Arg) { .v = &layouts[2] }))
* was changed to:	setlayout(&((Arg) { .v = &layouts[3] }))
* Now it works. This makese sense, the monocle layout that is in layout[3] in 
* my build.
/home/icefly/Stack/suckless/dwm/patches/test/dwm-fullscreen-6.2.diff
* The hotkeys of fullscreen and monocle are changed around, mod-f switches to
* fullscreen instead of mod-shift-f and mod-shif-t is now monocle.
/home/icefly/Stack/suckless/dwm/patches/test/dwm-removeborder-20200520-f09418b.diff
* Remark: removeborder added to removes the border in fullscreen.
* Layout of config.h redone, stuff moved around and commenting // removed.
