# :sparkles:Redox keyboard qmk configuration:sparkles:

My configuration has a qwerty layout and 4 additional layers. The CTRL SUPER
ALT buttons are part of the home row. The numpad layer is in home row (right side). 
The arrow keys layer and the mouse layer is also in the home row (right side). 
There is also a F-keys and backlight layer. Layer switching can be done by
keeping a left thumbkeys pressed or switched by tripple clicking. Go ahead and
check my configuration files.
