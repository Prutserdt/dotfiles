![Redox keyboard](Redox_keyboard.JPG)
My configuration has a qwerty layout and 4 additional layers. The CTRL SUPER
ALT buttons are part of the home row. The numbers can be accessed by a numpad 
layer and also a number layer on the home row. 
The arrow keys layer and the mouse layer are on the home row (right side). 
There is also a F-keys and backlight layer. Layer switching can be done by 
keeping a thumbkey pressed or by tripple clicking for a sticky layer. 
The backlight changes color with each layer.
Note; there is another number layer, on the qwerty row. This is meant for
the quantum keys (ctrl/gui/alt) that are on the home row and are overlapping.
Go ahead and check the keymap.c and config.h files!

Note: my layout is not a finished product yet and is changed frequently, the
picture could be different from the actual current layout, see the keymap.c
file.
