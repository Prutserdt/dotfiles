My configuration has a qwerty layout and 4 additional layers. 

![Redox layers](Layers.JPG)
NOTE: the two R buttons on layer 0 on the bottom right are macro buttons, and the S is the stop macro recording. The bottom left P buttons on layer 0 are the macro play buttons. The V button on layer 1 types out information about the current firmware version. Check my keymap.c for more details.
