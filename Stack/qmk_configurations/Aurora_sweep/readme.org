#+AUTHOR: Prutserdt

This is my personal QMK configuration of the [[https://splitkb.com/products/aurora-sweep][splitkb aurora sweep]], a minimalist layout keyboard with 34 keys.

Note, this keymap picture is visualized by https://keymap-drawer.streamlit.app/. Make sure that first a ferris sweep keymap.json is generated from https://config.qmk.fm/#/ferris/sweep/LAYOUT_split_3x5_2
After parsing the json in the streamlit app [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/Stack/qmk_configurations/Aurora_sweep/keymap_streamlit.yaml][this yaml-file]] should be pasted in and the keymap picture can be generated.

Please make sure to add the following line to the config.h file in the splitkb/aurora/sweep/rev1 directory or uncomment it in the config.h. If it is not there then it will not work!

#define SPLIT_USB_DETECT

The tenting solution is simply using a phone stand, as sugggested in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/13rfp7l/comment/l3l135m/?context=3][post]].

* Alternative configuration, vial

Clone the vial-qmk.git of splitkb, it will be cloned in the current directory, for instance ~cd ~/Downloads; git clone https://github.com/splitkb/vial-qmk.git~.
Now go to the ~/Downloads/vial-qmk/splitkb/aurora/sweep/rev1 directory and add to rules.mk: =BOOTLOADER = caterina= (for pro micro) and to config.h: =#define SPLIT_USB_DETECT=.
Compiling and flashing is performed from the cloned directory (~/Downloads/vial-qmk).
I like to use the mouse and use dynamic macros and customize further via vial. This is possible on a pro micro if other options are disabled.
Copy the =~/Downloads/vial-qmk/keyboards/splitkb/aurora/sweep/keymaps/vial-minimal= to another directory, for example vial-minimal_personal, and modify rules.mk in that directory to:

#+begin_src
VIA_ENABLE = yes
VIAL_ENABLE = yes

ENCODER_MAP_ENABLE = no

# A default 32u4 build is more than 8k oversized,
# so we have to disable some less-common / expert-level features.
GRAVE_ESC_ENABLE = no
SPACE_CADET_ENABLE = no
MAGIC_ENABLE = no
KEY_OVERRIDE_ENABLE = no
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = yes
COMBO_ENABLE = no
QMK_SETTINGS = no
DYANMIC_MACRO_ENABLE = yes
CONSOLE_ENABLE = no
COMMAND_ENABLE = no
UNICODE_ENABLE = no
OLED_ENABLE = no

SRC+=oneshot_shim.c
#+end_src

Now it is ready to compile and flash. Go to ~cd /Downloads/vial-qmk~ and compile by:
~qmk compile -kb splitkb/aurora/sweep -km vial-minimal-personal~.
Check if the .hex file is created in your directory and then flash it to the keyboard by
~qmk flash -kl splitkb_aurora_sweep_rev1_vial-minimal-personal.hex~.

Now the keyboard can be configured by vial. My keymap is attached as vial_layout_sweep.vil.
