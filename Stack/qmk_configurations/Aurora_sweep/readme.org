This is my personal QMK configuration of the [[https://splitkb.com/products/aurora-sweep][splitkb aurora sweep]], a minimalist layout keyboard with 34 keys.

Note, this keymap picture is visualized by https://keymap-drawer.streamlit.app/. Make sure that first a ferris sweep keymap.json is generated from https://config.qmk.fm/#/ferris/sweep/LAYOUT_split_3x5_2
After parsing the json in the streamlit app [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/Stack/qmk_configurations/Aurora_sweep/keymap_streamlit.yaml][this yaml-file]] should be pasted in and the keymap picture can be generated.

Please make sure to add the following line to the config.h file in the splitkb/aurora/sweep/rev1 directory or uncomment it in the config.h. If it is not there then it will not work!

#define SPLIT_USB_DETECT

The tenting solution is simply using a phone stand, as sugggested in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/13rfp7l/comment/l3l135m/?context=3][post]].
