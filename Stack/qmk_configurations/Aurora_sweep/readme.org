This is my personal QMK configuration of the [[https://splitkb.com/products/aurora-sweep][splitkb aurora sweep]], a minimalist layout keyboard with 34 keys.

This is my layout:

Please make sure to add the following line to the config.h file in the splitkb/aurora/sweep/rev1 directory or uncomment it in the config.h. If it is not there then it will not work!
#define SPLIT_USB_DETECT

The tenting solution is simply using a phone stand, as sugggested in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/13rfp7l/comment/l3l135m/?context=3][post]].
