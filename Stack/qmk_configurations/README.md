# :sparkles:QMK configuration of Redox and Gergo keyboards:sparkles:
Check my configuration of my Redox and Gergo keyboards.
They're awsome.
And by that I mean the kbs.
I like my configs but this is very personal and could be rubbish to you.

The directory locations are:
~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/redox
~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/gergo/keymaps/gergo
