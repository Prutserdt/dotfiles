#+TITLE: Prutserdt Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Prutserdt

Here I store the dotfiles of my GNU/Linux system plus some other stuff.

My config of qtile, a hackable tiling window manager written in Python, can be found [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/qtile][here]] and looks like this:
#+CAPTION: Qtilewindowmanager
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt windowmanager :title windowmanager :align left
[[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/raw/master/qtile.jpg]]

My build of dwm, a dynamic window manager, can be found [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/suckless/dwm][here]] and is similar to my qtile setup:
#+CAPTION: DWM windowmanager
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt windowmanager :title windowmanager :align left
[[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/raw/master/dwm2.jpg]]

The qmk configurations of the ortholinear ergonomic split keyboards Redox and Gergo are living [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/Stack/qmk_configurations][here]].

My old i3 gaps config file and surf and st builds are still a part of this repo although I do not use them anymore.

* Managing my dotfiles
The ~dotfiles~ command is  an [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases][alias]] which runs a simple [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dotfiles.sh][bash script]] and push/pulls to this github repo and uses the [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases][alias]] ~config~.
** Add a new dotfile to my repo
#+begin_src sh
    config add .example
    dotfiles
#+end_src

** Remove a dotfile from my repo
#+begin_src sh
    config rm .example
    dotfiles
#+end_src

Remember to add to ~/dotfiles/config
#+begin_src sh
[remote "origin"]
	url = ssh://git@github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles.git
#+end_src
