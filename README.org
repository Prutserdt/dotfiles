* Prutserdt Dotfiles
Here I store the dotfiles of my GNU/Linux system plus some other stuff.

My config of qtile, a hackable tiling window manager written in python, can be found [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/qtile/README.org][here]]. My build of dwm, a dynamic window manager, can be found [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/suckless/dwm][here]]. This is my typical setup (qtile/dwm), minimal and boring:

#+CAPTION: My windowmanager
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt windowmanager :title windowmanager :align left

The qmk configurations of the ortholinear ergonomic split keyboards Redox and Gergo are living [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/Stack/qmk_configurations][here]].

My old i3 gaps config file and surf and st builds are still a part of this repo although I do not use them anymore.

* Managing the dotfiles
The `dotfiles` command is an alias which runs a simple bash script and push/pulls to this github repo and it uses another alias called config.

** Add new dotfile to my repo
    config add .example
    config commit -m "Add my .example"
    config push -v
** Remove a dotfile from my repo
    config rm .example
    config commit -m "Remove my .example"
    config push -v

Remember to change the ~/dotfiles/config to ssh: url = ssh://git@github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles.git
