#+TITLE: Prutserdt Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Prutserdt

Here I store the dotfiles of my GNU/Linux system plus some other stuff.

My config of qtile, a hackable tiling window manager written in python, can be found [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/qtile/README.org][here]]. My build of dwm, a dynamic window manager, can be found [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/suckless/dwm][here]]. This is my typical setup (qtile/dwm), minimal and boring:

The qmk configurations of the ortholinear ergonomic split keyboards Redox and Gergo are living [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/tree/master/Stack/qmk_configurations][here]].

My old i3 gaps config file and surf and st builds are still a part of this repo although I do not use them anymore.

* Managing my dotfiles
The `dotfiles` command is  an [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases][alias]] which runs a simple [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dotfiles.sh][bash script]] and push/pulls to this github repo and uses another [[https://github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases][alias]] called config.
** Add new dotfile to my repo
#+begin_src sh
    config add .example
    config commit -m "Add my .example"
    config push -v
#+end_src

** Remove a dotfile from my repo
#+begin_src sh
    config rm .example
    config commit -m "Remove my .example"
    config push -v
#+end_src

Remember to change the ~/dotfiles/config to ssh: url = ssh://git@github.com/Prutserdt/dotfiles.git
