dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

My builds are made in my home direcotory (~/suckless/dwm) and I'm not using
GIT. Go to this directory and enter as normal user:

    make clean install

Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

DWM patching
------------
1. Download a patch from suckless.org and place the patch at a set location 
   (~/Stack/suckless/patches/test)
2. Run from command line the .bashrc alias: dwmpatch
3. Press super-ctrl-shift-q to restart dwm inplace. If the patch is usefull
   then save as a stable version

Safe as stable version
------------
1. Run from command line the .bashrc alias: dwmbackup
2. Press super-ctrl-shift-q to restart dwm inplace

2. Press super-ctrl-shift-q to restart dwm inplace

and (re)compiling the source code.
