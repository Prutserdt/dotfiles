This is my build of dwm - dynamic window manager. An extremely fast, small, 
and dynamic window manager for X.

Check the log directory for the applied patches.
Check the config.h file for my key bindings. Super_R and Alt_R buttons are set
by .Xmodmap.

My builds are made in my home direcotory (~/suckless/dwm). 
Go to that directory and enter as normal user:
make clean install

Make a symlink to ~/bin
'ln -s -v ~/suckless/dwm/dwm ~/bin/dwm'

Running dwm
-----------
Add the following lines to your .xinitrc:

# Menu bar
~/.config/dwmbar.sh &
# Start picom, for transparancy
picom -b
# Run dwm, a sym link in  ~/bin, and the path was set in .bashrc
exec dwm
# if dwm exits 0, restart -- this allows hot reloading of config.h
# aka: Ctrl-Super-Shift-Q to restart in place.
while type dwm >/dev/null ; do dwm && continue || break ; done

Run 'startx' from commandline.

dwm patching
------------
1. Download a patch from suckless.org and place the patch at a set location 
   (~/Stack/suckless/dwm/patches/test)
2. Run from command line the .bashrc alias: dwmpatch
3. If the patch is usefull then safe as a stable version.
