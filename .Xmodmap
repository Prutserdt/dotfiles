! This dotfile is autostarted in dwm ~/dwm/config.def.h (and i3wm ~/.config/i3/config)

! Super_R key is set to mod3, this button is used for keybindings to apps in dwm and i3wm, see ~/.config/i3/config
remove mod4 = Super_R
add mod3 = Super_R

! Alt_R key is set to mod5, this button is used for keybindings to files in dwm, see ~/dwm/config.def.h
remove mod1 = Alt_R
add mod5 = Alt_R

! A little hack for VIM. The Caps_Lock becomes the Escape key and vice versa.
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock
