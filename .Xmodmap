! This dotfile is autostarted in i3wm ~/.config/i3/config

! Super_R key is set to mod3, this button is used for keybindings to apps in i3wm, see ~/.config/i3/config
remove mod4 = Super_R
add mod3 = Super_R

! A little hack for VIM. The Caps_Lock becomes the Escape key and vice versa.
! This way the change is permanent; also outside vim. Alternatively this could be modified in the
! vimrc file.
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock
